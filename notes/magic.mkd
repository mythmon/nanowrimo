Magic does not violate conservation of mass/energy, nor can it act faster than
the speed of light (caveat: time travel).

To move an object with magic requires expending mana with equal potential energy
as to move the object by itself. For this reason, mana is measured in Joules.

Magic is mental. Most casters use somatic gestures as well to focus their
attention.
