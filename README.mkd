This is my [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org) for November 2014.

This is a first draft. It is incomplete, will be messy and will
have errors. Pull requests to fix syntax are **not** welcome,
because I am trying to focus on writing, not editing. Most other
pull requests also probably aren't welcome until after the month
is over.
